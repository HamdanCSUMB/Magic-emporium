View Inventory screen
The view inventory should have
    a search bar to look for items
    a category drop down to be able to search for items by category
        this should work with the search to look for the items in that category as well
    The items themselves
        Each item should have:
            a name
            (if time allows, an image of the item)
            price
            description
            category
            stock
                if stock is 0 item will still be shown
        button to add to cart
            should prompt the user for how many to purchase
                maybe a dropdown up to the current stock
    back/cancel button to go back to the "logged in" screen
    View cart button
        Here the User will be able to view their cart of items they want to purchase
